# Range Finder 2000

This pro add in provides a map tool that when clicked will display the ranges and the approximate address of the road clicked. This is the modernization of some [old spillman vba](https://github.com/agrc/Spillman/blob/master/vba/OldVBA/CenterlineAddressSplit) code and is intended to help make finding and fixing issues in spillman data easier.
